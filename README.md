## Introduction:
This software application is straightforward, designed to compute the time response of underdamped single-degree-of-freedom (1 DOF) systems using the discrete Beta Newmark method. Importantly, this software should not be seen as a replacement for formal classroom instruction but rather as a tool to supplement it. It was developed mainly for underdamped systems subjected to non-periodic and non-harmonic external excitations, like earthquakes. The primary purpose of this tool is to provide students with a visual aid, helping them comprehend how structures behave during actual seismic events. In doing so, users should be aware of the inherent simplifications and approximations in the 1 DOF Beta-Newmark calculation.

Moreover, it is essential for users of this academic software to have sufficient knowledge regarding the step-by-step time-domain response calculation of 1 DOF systems. To familiarize oneself with the mathematical foundation, you can visit the repository [XXXX], where you will find an academic summary on this topic.

### Installation Steps:

    * For optimal performance, install 7zip (free software).
    * Using 7zip, WinRAR, or a similar software, unzip the file "TH_SDOF_CC_setup.7z.001" to your desired location.
    * Note: Ensure all files downloaded from the repository are in the same folder.
    * Once unzipped, an executable file named "TH_SDOF_CC_setup.exe" will appear. Double-click this file to initiate the installation process. Simply follow the on-screen instructions thereafter.
